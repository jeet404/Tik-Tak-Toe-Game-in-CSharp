# Tik-Tak-Toe-Game-in-CSharp
By using C# and Visual Studio, I decided to have some fun by coding a console version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Also known as Naughts and Crosses, Exey Oseys or Xs and Os. It's a fun game to code, below is an overview of the project file. Feel free to edit or improve the code for your own project!
